EMotion and MOvement Variabilily: a PILOT STUDY (emmov-pilotstudy)
---

On 9th of September 2017, as part of my participation in the OpenDay at Uni of Bham,
I conducted a simple pilot study where seven participants interact with [ NAO ()째 .째) ](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/nao).
For the experiment, ten repetitions of simple upper arms movements were performed by the person and NAO ()째 .째).
Participants were asked to imitate what the robot does while time series from 
inertial sensors [(razor IMU)](https://github.com/mxochicale/emmov-pilotstudy/tree/master/data/razor_imu)
and video [with OpenFace](https://github.com/mxochicale/emmov-pilotstudy/tree/master/data/openface) were collected.
