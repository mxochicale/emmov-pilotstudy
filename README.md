## Pilot Study Description
On 9th of September 2017, as part of my participation in the OpenDay at Uni of Bham,
I conducted a simple pilot study where six participants interact with [ NAO ()째 .째) ](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/nao).
Participants were asked to imitate what the robot does while time series from 
inertial sensors and video were collected.
Ten repetitions of upper arm were performed by [ NAO ()째 .째) ](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/nao).
