## Pilot Study Description
On 9th of September 2017, as part of my participation to the OpenDay at Uni of Bham,
I conducted a simple pilot study where six participants interact with NAO.
Participants were asked to imitate what the robot does while time series from 
inertial sensors and video were collected.
Ten repetitions of upper arm were performed by NAO.
