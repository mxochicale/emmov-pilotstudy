---

On 9th of September 2017, as part of my participation in the OpenDay at Uni of Bham,
I conducted a simple pilot study where six participants interact with [ NAO ()째 .째) ](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/nao).
For the experiment, ten repetitions of upper arm were performed by the person and NAO ()째 .째).
Participants were asked to imitate what the robot does while time series from 
inertial sensors [with razor IMU](https://github.com/mxochicale/emmov-pilotstudy/tree/master/data/razor_imu)
and [video to get face landmarks with OpenFace](https://github.com/mxochicale/emmov-pilotstudy/tree/master/data/openface) were collected.
